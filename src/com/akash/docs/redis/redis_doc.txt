https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10558465/memcached-vs-redis

Why to use?
When to use?

==> Redis vs Memcache
-> both acts as a key-value cache (fast in read/write), but
	Memcached has no mechanisms for dumping data to disk without 3rd party tools.
	i.e. if server gets down in memcache then data is lost.
	Redis dumps data on disk.
	redis persists your data to disk using a mechanism called snapshotting.
-> Redis is highly scalable, memcache is not.
	memcache does not support replication.
-> it has in build data structures like :
	String, hash, set, list, sorted list, geo-spatial indexes, Stream
-> Redis supports 'pipelining', in which multiple commands can be fired at once
-> Both are atomic.
	In Redis as soon as you write a value to redis that value is visible to all clients connected to redis.

==> Redis use case :
-> session data cache
-> full page cache
-> Leaderboards/Counting of an online game
-> geo search


===> Redis 

In memory key value store with persistence.

It can be used 
as a cache
as a database (NoSql DB)
as a message broker

Remote Dictionary Server


Data structures :
String, hash, list, set, sortedSet

cached data in redis can viewed via redis client.

-> Issues with Redis
*** https://tech.trivago.com/2017/01/25/learn-redis-the-hard-way-in-production/

Redis is single threaded
Must not be shared bw teams
disable persistence of data if not required
close connection after request completion
Sharding will help you :
    1) avoid hitting query like KEYS *
    2) RAM consumption and high read/write requests can be handled via consistent hashing

--------------------

NOTE : Every key in redis has an expiry time
By default expiry time for a key is infinite


redis> expire abc 10
redis> TTL abc

it will set expiry time of given key as 10 seconds
TTL of infinite is -1
TTL is -2 means key does not exist

------------------------

=> ordered list operation :

RPUSH
LPUSH
RPOP
LPOP
LLEN
LRANGE

RPUSH list "20"
RPUSH list "25"
LPUSH list "15"

LLEN list 
	//3

LRANGE list 0 2
	//15 , 20 , 25
LRANGE list 0 5
	//15 , 20 , 25

LRANGE list 0 -1
	// get all elements of list

NOTE : Every addition operation of list returns size of list


------------------------

=> Unordered Set :

SADD
SREM
SISMEMBERS
SMEMBERS
SUNION


SADD set "1"
SADD set "4"
SADD set "10"
SADD set "abc"

SREM set "1"

SMEMBERS set 
	//4, 10, abc

NOTE : Every addition operation of Set returns 0 or 1, if this element added or not

SUNION combines two or more sets and returns the list of all elements.

Sets are not sorted
To sort sets we use SortedSets

------------------------

=> Sorted Set operation :

each value has an associated score

ZADD hackers 1940 "Alan Kay"
ZADD hackers 1906 "Grace Hopper"
ZADD hackers 1953 "Richard Stallman"
ZADD hackers 1965 "Yukihiro Matsumoto"
ZADD hackers 1916 "Claude Shannon"
ZADD hackers 1969 "Linus Torvalds"
ZADD hackers 1957 "Sophie Wilson"
ZADD hackers 1912 "Alan Turing"


the scores are years of birth and the values are the names of famous hackers.

ZRANGE hackers 2 4 => 1) "Claude Shannon", 2) "Alan Kay", 3) "Richard Stallman"



------------------------

=> Hashes  (similar to map with where value contains group of key-value pair)





-------------------------
# setup redis cluster (3 masters/shards with 0 replication) on localhost

edit redis.conf file

# bind 127.0.0.1
protected-mode no
port 7003
pidfile /var/run/redis_7003.pid
cluster-enabled yes

redis-cli --cluster create 127.0.0.1:7001 127.0.0.1:7002 127.0.0.1:7003 --cluster-replicas 0

[OK] All nodes agree about slots configuration.


// to connect with a redis node

redis-cli -c -h 127.0.0.1 -p 7001


=====================================

*** https://redis.io/topics/cluster-tutorial

=> Redis Cluster data sharding
Redis Cluster does not use consistent hashing, it uses hash slots for each master node
There are 16384 hash slots which are equally divided

*Every node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots
current nodes : A B C
Add new node D
I need to move some hash slot from nodes A, B, C to D.

Remove node A
Move hash slots from A to B, C, D
moving hash slots from a node to another does not have downtime.

=> Redis Cluster master-slave model

Data from master to slave is sent asynchronously
Redis Cluster is not able to guarantee strong consistency.

client writes data to master -> data saved on master -> master acknoledges -> master propagates data to slaves asynchronoulsy.
