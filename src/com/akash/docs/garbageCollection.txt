GC thread is a daemon thread in JVM which checks for unreachable objects in java,
and remove them from memory.

general steps for deleting unused memory:
marking		: mark used and unused memory
deletion	: deleting unused memory 
compacting	: compacting the memory

Three Generations are created :
(1)Young
(2)Old
(3)Permanent

==>Objects in Young gen are those which live very shortly.
when an object stay in young for long duration(fixed for an algo),
it is moved to Old gen.
->Minor collection is done at Young generation space.

OLD  = EDEN + S1 + S2


==>Old gen is the space where long lived objects are saved.
->Major collection is done here.


==>Permanent gen is where class and methods metadata is saved.
garbage collection is also performed here.

(Q)Why these three generations are created?
Analysis shows that there are very few objects that have a long life 
as compared to short lived objects.

(Q) finalize() in Object class
this method runs when an object is garbage collected.
can override this.

(Q)How to call garbage collector?

System.gc();

Runtime.getRuntime().gc();

we can only request garbage collector but cannot force it.
