system design of my current project
how concurrency is handled in checking total count of a promocode

(2) nodes at a distance of 2 (upward and downward)
binary tree
startNode = 12
k = 2

	10
      12   14
    4   7
       8  9  

answer : 8,9,14

|        |   |
6->7     8   9
|
10



1-> 2-> 3 -> 4 -> 5-> 6-> 7-> 8->9 -> 10

without taking extra memory
with only single iteration
